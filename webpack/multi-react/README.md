# Practice

- [x] setting 3 react project, 1 shell and 2 remote
- [x] setting react remote (css module ) import into shell
- [x] using lerna to config run parallel when develop
- [x] app4 with tailwindcss => only import something you need
- [!] change app3 to version 16 of react (Nothing problem), import app2 component to app 3 (Get problem => the solution from [https://github.com/module-federation/module-federation-examples/tree/master/different-react-versions] only help a little => component of the app2 will render by react16-dom, it not expected => check later with option useIntersectEffect of react 18)
- [x] change app2 to typescript, import to app1 (addition props pass from app1 to app2)
- [x] testing with cypress simple ( load all app, check app1 with all dynamic loading remote)
- [] init addition 1 vue project as remote
- [] share theme ( dark, light) state between 3 remote and shell
