            <h4>Repository</h4>
            <div>
                <p>
                    A repository, or repo, serves as a storage space where your project's source code and its version
                    history are
                    stored.

            <h4>Working Directory</h4>
            <div>
                <p>
                    The working directory is where you currently make changes to your project, housing the files you are
                    actively
                    working on.
                </p>

        <section>
            <h4>Staging</h4>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Staging acts as an intermediate area between the repository and your working directory. It's where
                    you add
                    changes before committing them to the main repository.
